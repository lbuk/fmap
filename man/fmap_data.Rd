\arguments{
\item{ncircles}{Number of concentric circles of equal area}

\item{radius_inner}{Radius of innermost circle in metres}

\item{radius_outer}{Radius of outermost circle in metres}

\item{lat}{Latitude of the centre of the Fresnel Map}

\item{lon}{Longitude of the centre of the Fresnel Map}

\item{geo_centre}{A spatial dataset containing the coordinates of the centre of the Fresnel Map}

\item{geo_points}{A spatial dataset of points to aggregate}

\item{sum}{Variable from geo_points for calculating sum}

}
\value{
An sf dataset of Fresnel Map polygons based on aggregations of points-based data with a custom Azimuthal Equidistant (AEQD) CRS.
}
\description{
Function for creating Fresnel Map polygons by aggregating data to the level of equal-area concentric circles (or annuli).
}
\examples{
# Load the sf datasets of cholera deaths and Soho pumps
data(choleradeaths, sohopumps)

# Filter the Broad Street Pump from the Soho pumps dataset
broadstreetpump = sohopumps \%>\% filter(Soho.Pump == "Broad Street")

fmap_data(radius_inner = 125, ncircles = 8, geo_centre = broadstreetpump, geo_points = choleradeaths, sum = "Cholera.Deaths")
